- Drops support for PHP 7.1

## [1.0.2] - 2019-10-03
- Fixed issues with PHPUnit 8.4  This version of PHPUnit did away with the `InvokedRecorder` class. So, now I can't really keep a firm type hint on the `expects()` method. The type hint has been removed and will have to just rely on users reading the documentation.

- Fixed a couple compatibility issues with PHPUnit 7.0.0
- Added badges for the readme

- Initial Release
